What is RevenueCat?
RevenueCat provides a backend and SDKs that wrap StoreKit, Google Play Billing, and RevenueCat Web Billing to make implementing in-app and web purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about how RevenueCat fits into your app or you can sign up free to start building.

Installation
Release

Make sure that the deployment target for iOS is at least 13.4 and Android is at least 6.0 (API 23) as defined here.

React Native package
Purchases for React Native can be installed either via npm or yarn.

We recommend using the latest version of React Native, or making sure that the version is at least greater than 0.64.

Option 1.1: Using auto-linking
Recent versions of React Native will automatically link the SDK, so all that's needed is to install the library.

npm
yarn
npm install --save react-native-purchases


Option 1.2: Manual linking
npm
yarn
npm install --save react-native-purchases


After that, you should link the library to the native projects by doing:

Shell
react-native link react-native-purchases


Using Expo
Use Expo to rapidly iterate on your app by using JavaScript/TypeScript exclusively, while letting Expo take care of everything else.

See Using RevenueCat with Expo to get started.

Set the correct launchMode for Android
Depending on your user's payment method, they may be asked by Google Play to verify their purchase in their (banking) app. This means they will have to background your app and go to another app to verify the purchase. If your Activity's launchMode is set to anything other than standard or singleTop, backgrounding your app can cause the purchase to get cancelled. To avoid this, set the launchMode of your Activity to standard or singleTop in your Android app's AndroidManifest.xml file, like so:

AndroidManifest.xml
<activity 
    android:name="com.your.Activity"
    android:launchMode="standard" />  <!-- or singleTop -->


You can find Android's documentation on the various launchMode options here.

Import Purchases
You should now be able to import Purchases.

React Native
import Purchases from 'react-native-purchases';


📘Include BILLING permission for Android projects
Don't forget to include the BILLING permission in your AndroidManifest.xml file

AndroidManifest.xml
<uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />


📘Enable In-App Purchase capability for your iOS project
Don't forget to enable the In-App Purchase capability for your project under Project Target -> Capabilities -> In-App Purchase

Android Build Issues
R8 Dependencies Conflict
If you encounter build failures related to R8 (Android's code shrinker) when using react-native-purchases-ui, you may see errors like:

Execution failed for task ':app:mergeExtDexDevDebug'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':app:devDebugRuntimeClasspath'.

This issue occurs due to a bug in earlier versions of Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) that affects R8 dependency resolution. To fix this, add the following to your project-level build.gradle file (not app/build.gradle):

build.gradle (project level)
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            url = uri("https://storage.googleapis.com/r8-releases/raw")
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools:r8:8.1.44")
    }
}

This solution forces the use of a specific R8 version that resolves the dependency conflicts. For more details, see the Google Issue Tracker.

Next Steps
Now that you've installed the Purchases SDK in your React Native app, get started by initializing an instance of Purchases →
