## Full Description

**Stop rewinding. Start cooking.**

You've saved hundreds of recipe videos on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. That incredible pasta dish. The viral baked feta. Your aunt's jollof rice tutorial. But when you actually go to cook them? You can't find the video. You're pausing every five seconds with flour-covered fingers. You forget which ingredients you already added. You lose your place in the steps. You give up halfway through.

**Recipe Hunter changes everything.**

We use AI to transform any cooking video into clear, organized, step-by-step recipes you can actually follow. In seconds, you go from a messy video you're pausing with greasy fingers to organized instructions, shopping lists, and a meal plan to actually cook what you saved.

• Step-by-step cooking instructions in order
• Cooking times and temperatures

Processing takes 30-60 seconds. Then it's yours forever.
